  "description": "Welcome to my Book Club API Project repository! This project was born from the need of a book club to democratize reading through the donation of already read books. They wanted a way for people beyond the club members to participate in donations and also borrow books. For this purpose, I created an API that allows user registration and authentication, and provides the capability to the user add new books, consult all existing books in the database, borrow books, and see a list of books they've borrowed.",
